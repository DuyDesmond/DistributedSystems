# File Deletion Bug Fix - Summary

## Problem Description

When running 2 instances of the client (client and client2) on the same account, files deleted from the `sync` folder would reappear after a short moment, even if deleted from both sync folders.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by **race conditions and improper coordination** between multiple clients during file deletion:

1. **Client A** deletes a file from the sync folder
2. `FileWatchService` detects the deletion and calls `queueFileForDeletion()`
3. The file is marked as "DELETED" in Client A's local database
4. The deletion request is sent to the server and the file is deleted from the server
5. **Client B** runs its periodic sync and gets the updated file list from the server
6. Since the file was deleted from the server, it's not in the server's file list anymore
7. **CRITICAL ISSUE**: The `cleanupDeletedFiles()` method would remove the DELETED marker from the database
8. During the next sync cycle, Client B would see the file missing locally and re-download it from cache or if another client still had it

## The Fix

### 1. Enhanced `cleanupDeletedFiles()` Method

**Before:**
```java
// Remove from local database
databaseService.removeFileRecord(filePath);
logger.info("Removed database record for deleted file: {}", filePath);
```

**After:**
```java
// Remove from local database only if file doesn't exist on server
// Keep DELETED status if file was marked as deleted locally
if (!serverFilePaths.contains(filePath) && !"DELETED".equals(syncStatus)) {
    databaseService.removeFileRecord(filePath);
    logger.info("Removed database record for file deleted on server: {}", filePath);
} else if ("DELETED".equals(syncStatus)) {
    // File was deleted locally, keep the DELETED marker for a while
    logger.debug("Keeping DELETED marker for locally deleted file: {}", filePath);
}
```

### 2. Better DELETED Marker Management

- **DELETED markers are preserved** to prevent re-download of files that were intentionally deleted
- Only database records for files deleted on the server (not locally) are removed
- This ensures coordination between multiple clients

### 3. Added Cleanup for Old DELETED Markers

Added `cleanupOldDeletedMarkers()` method that runs during periodic sync to prevent database bloat:
- Removes DELETED markers for files that no longer exist locally after sufficient time
- Prevents the database from growing indefinitely with old deletion markers
- Gives enough time (1 hour) for all clients to sync the deletion

## Key Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `client/src/main/java/com/filesync/client/service/EnhancedSyncService.java`
2. `client2/src/main/java/com/filesync/client/service/EnhancedSyncService.java`

### Methods Enhanced:
1. **`cleanupDeletedFiles()`** - Better handling of DELETED markers
2. **`performPeriodicSync()`** - Added cleanup of old DELETED markers
3. **`cleanupOldDeletedMarkers()`** - New method to prevent database bloat

## How the Fix Works

1. **When a file is deleted:**
   - File is marked as "DELETED" in the local database immediately
   - Deletion request is sent to the server
   - Local file is removed from the filesystem

2. **During periodic sync on other clients:**
   - Files marked as "DELETED" are skipped during sync operations
   - The DELETED marker prevents re-download even if the file appears to be missing
   - Only files deleted on the server (not locally) have their database records removed

3. **Long-term cleanup:**
   - Old DELETED markers are eventually cleaned up to prevent database bloat
   - This happens after sufficient time has passed for all clients to sync

## Testing the Fix

1. **Create a test file** in `client/sync/` folder
2. **Wait for sync** (30-60 seconds) until it appears in `client2/sync/`
3. **Delete the file** from `client/sync/` using file explorer
4. **Wait and observe** - the file should disappear from `client2/sync/` and **stay deleted**

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ File disappears from both sync folders
- ✅ File stays deleted and doesn't reappear
- ✅ No race conditions or re-download issues

### Previous (Buggy) Behavior:
- ❌ File would reappear after deletion
- ❌ Files would be re-downloaded even after manual deletion
- ❌ Race conditions between multiple clients

## Technical Benefits

1. **Race Condition Protection**: DELETED markers prevent race conditions during multi-client sync
2. **Better Coordination**: Multiple clients now properly coordinate file deletions
3. **Database Hygiene**: Old markers are cleaned up to prevent bloat
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Changes don't break existing functionality

## Files to Test

Use the provided test script: `test-deletion-fix.bat`

This fix ensures reliable file deletion behavior across multiple synchronized clients.
