echo Testing File Deletion Bug Fix
echo =============================
echo.

echo This test will help you verify that the deletion bug is fixed.
echo.
echo Instructions:
echo 1. Make sure both server and clients are running
echo 2. Create a test file in client/sync folder
echo 3. Wait for it to sync to client2/sync folder
echo 4. Delete the file from client/sync folder
echo 5. Check if file disappears from client2/sync folder and doesn't reappear
echo.

echo Key changes made to fix the deletion bug:
echo.
echo 1. IMPROVED cleanupDeletedFiles method:
echo    - Now preserves DELETED markers to prevent re-download
echo    - Only removes database records for server-deleted files
echo    - Keeps local deletion markers for coordination
echo.
echo 2. ENHANCED deletion flow:
echo    - Files marked as DELETED immediately prevent re-download
echo    - Better coordination between multiple clients
echo    - Race condition protection during deletion
